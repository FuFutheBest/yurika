| `gh` | Toggle hidden files: Show/Hide files starting with `.`                                                                                    |

# Copy & Move

Netrw's copy/move logic is: first mark the Target directory, then mark the Source files, and finally execute.

Operation flow:

1. Set Target Directory: Move the cursor to the directory where you want to place the files, press `mt` (Mark Target).
   - Tip: The top Banner will show `Target: ...`

2. Select Files: Move to the files you want to operate on, press `mf` (Mark File) to mark them.
   - Tip: The marked filenames will become bold or change color; you can mark multiple files.

3. Execute Command:
   - Press `mc`: Copy marked files to the target directory (Copy).
   - Press `mm`: Move marked files to the target directory (Move).

| Key  | Function                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| `mt` | Mark current directory as Target    |
| `mf` | Mark/Unmark file under the cursor   |
| `mu` | Unmark all marked files             |
| `mc` | Execute Copy marked files to Target |
| `mm` | Execute Move marked files to Target |

# Bookmarks

Quickly jump to frequently used directories.

| Key  | Function                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mb` | Set bookmark: Add the current directory to the bookmark list             |
| `qb` | View bookmarks: List all bookmarks and history paths                     |
| `gb` | Go to bookmark: Jump to the next bookmark location                       |
| `mB` | Delete bookmark: Remove the bookmark under the cursor (use in `qb` list) |

# Remote Editing

Netrw's killer feature, supporting SCP, SFTP, FTP, and more. Vim automatically downloads files to `/tmp` and uploads them upon saving.

Syntax:

```vim
:e scp://user@host//path/to/file
```

:::note

The double slashes `//` after the host indicate an absolute path from the root directory; a single slash `/` indicates a path relative to the user's home directory.

:::

Examples:

- Edit remote file: `:e scp://root@192.168.1.10://etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
- Browse remote directory: `:Ex scp://user@myserver.com/projects/`

# Configuration

See `:h netrw-setup` for detailed configuration options. Here are my commonly used settings:

```vim

-- ===========================
--        Netrw Config
-- ===========================

local g = vim.g

g.netrw_liststyle = 3      -- Use tree-style listing
g.netrw_keepdir = 0        -- Allow changing CWD
g.netrw_browse_split = 4   -- Reuse window if possible
g.netrw_altv = 1           -- When splitting vertically, open the new window to the right
g.netrw_preview = 1        -- Enable file preview window
g.netrw_fastbrowse = 1     -- Enable fast browsing

```
